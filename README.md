# TMA4212-Numerical Solution of Differential Equations by Difference Methods

In both projects we discribe and prove much of the neccessary theory behind both finite difference and finite element methods.  

Project 1: In this project we modeled the heat distribution in both isotropic and anisotropic materials through the use of FDM. Score: 20/20

Project 2: In this project we modeled stationary convection diffusion problems using FEM.
